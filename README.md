# flexible_skill_progression
With this mod all the skills requirements are related to character level instead of main skill level.

This mod frees all the child skills from their parent skill so you have 100% freedom to build your ultimate super survivor!
You still can (and should!) spend points in the main skills as they provide good buffs to their related weapons/tools, but the only requirement to unlock child skills is to level up your character past levels 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40.

For skills that have 5 leveles (like DeadEye or Boomstick) the requirements are:
- Level 1: Character Level 5
- Level 2: Character Level 10
- Level 3: Character Level 20
- Level 4: Character Level 30
- Level 5: Character Level 40

For skills that have 4 leveles (like SexualTRex or Parkour) the requirements are:
- Level 1: Character Level 10
- Level 2: Character Level 20
- Level 3: Character Level 30
- Level 4: Character Level 40

For skills that have 3 leveles (like LockPicking or TreasureHunter) the requirements are:
- Level 1: Character Level 10
- Level 2: Character Level 20
- Level 3: Character Level 30

This numbers are NOT the result of thorough balancing and testing, but they seem fair to me.
I only tested it in ALPHA 20 and it should be compatible with anything that doesn't make big changes to progression.xml
